# System-Simulation-Tool

This Python-based tool allows you to simulate a system with a given transfer function. It provides a graphical representation of the input and output signals, enabling you to visualize the system's behavior.

Prerequisites
Before running the simulation tool, make sure you have the following libraries installed:

Python:
NumPy
Matplotlib
Tkinter (for the graphical user interface)

Getting Started:

Clone the repository or download the Python script.
Open the Python script in your preferred development environment or text editor.
Launch the script.
The graphical user interface (GUI) will appear, allowing you to input various parameters for the simulation.


Input Signal Plot: A plot showing the input signal's amplitude over time.
Output Signal Plot: A plot showing the output signal's amplitude over time.
Notes
The simulation uses Euler's method for numerical integration.
The input signal can be chosen from three types: square wave, triangular wave, or sine wave.
